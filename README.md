This is an API and back end code that can be used for a e-commerce site. It runs on an express server using Sequelize models that interact with a MySQL2 database.

The user can make GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE calls in Insomnia or other API testing program. Calls can be made to retrieve and view the database items, by category, product or tag. Categories, products, and tags can be viewed, updated, added or deleted.
